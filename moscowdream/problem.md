For many students, getting a ticket to The ICPC World Finals is a huge achievement, and The 2019 ICPC Asia Danang Regional Contest is a chance to make their dream come true. For some others, they just like to stretch their brains and solve interesting problems.

We – the scientific committee understand that, and we tried our best to set up a problemset that is interesting and diverse in both topics and difficulty. For a few months, we called for problem proposals from many people and received 𝑎 easy problems, 𝑏 medium problems and 𝑐 hard problems. Using these proposals, we want to create a problemset which:

Consists of exactly 𝑛 problems,

Has at least 1 easy problem,

Has at least 1 medium problem,

Has at least 1 hard problem.

Your task is to check whether it is possible to create such a problemset using the available problems.

## Input
The input contains 4 integers 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 and 𝑛 (0≤𝑎,𝑏,𝑐≤10,1≤𝑛≤20).

## Output
Print ‘YES’ if it is possible to create a problemset satisfying above requirements, and ‘NO’ otherwise.

## Explanation of sample data
In the first sample, the committee do not have any easy problem. Thus, they cannot create a problemset with at least 1 easy problem.

In the second sample, the committee can use 3 easy problems, 7 medium problems and 3 hard problems to create a problemset with exactly 13 problems.
